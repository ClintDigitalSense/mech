Instead of building a virtual machine from scratch, which would be a slow and
tedious process, Mech uses a base image to quickly clone a virtual machine.
These base images are known as "boxes" in Mech, and specifying the box to use
for your Mech environment is always the first step after creating a new Mechfile.
