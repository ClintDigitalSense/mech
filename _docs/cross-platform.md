Mech works on Mac, Linux, Windows, and more. Remote development
environments force users to give up their favorite editors and
programs. Mech works on your local system with the tools you're
already familiar with. Easily code in your favorite text editor,
edit images in your favorite manipulation program, and debug
using your favorite tools, all from the comfort of your local
laptop.


## Uncompromised Portability

VMware virtual machines run on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux. Mech provides
support for both VMware Fusion (Mac OS X) and VMware Workstation (Linux and
Windows), which are able to run the same virtual machines across multiple
platforms.
