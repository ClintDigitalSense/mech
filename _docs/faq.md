### Do I need to pay to get a license?
No, Mech is free and open source (MIT license)


---

### Does this include the VMware software?
No. Mech requires the separate purchase of VMware Fusion/Workstation from VMware. The VMware product is not bundled with the application.


---

### Can I use VMware Workstation Player?
Maybe. Some features of Mech will work with VMware Player, but it is not officially supported. Mech interacts with VMware via the VMware API, and some versions of VMware Workstation Player do not support those APIs. When in doubt, please purchase VMware Workstation Pro to use all the features supported by the integration.


---

### Do I need VMware Fusion/Workstation Pro or just the regular version?
Mech is compatible with both the regular and Pro versions of VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation. However, some advanced features (such as linked clones), are only supported by the Pro versions of the VMware software.

Please consult the VMware documentation to determine which features are supported by the Pro and non-Pro versions to determine which product you need to purchase.
